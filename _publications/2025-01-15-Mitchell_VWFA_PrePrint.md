Abstract
======
Understanding the balance between plastic and persistent traits in the dyslexic brain is critical for developing effective interventions. This longitudinal intervention study examines the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) in dyslexic and typical readers, exploring how this key component of the brain's reading circuitry changes with learning. We found that dyslexic readers show significant differences in VWFA presence, size, and tuning properties compared to typical readers. While reading intervention improved reading skills and increased VWFA size, disparities persisted, suggesting that VWFA abnormalities are an enduring trait of dyslexia. Notably, we found that even with sufficient intervention to close the reading skill gap, dyslexic readers are still expected to have smaller VWFAs. Our results reveal intervention-driven long-term neural and behavioral changes, while also elucidating stable differences in the functional architecture of the dyslexic brain. This provides new insights into the potential and limitations of learning-induced plasticity in the human visual cortex.
