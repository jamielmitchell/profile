Abstract
======
Inferior frontal cortex (IFC) is a critical region for reading and language. This part of the cortex is highly heterogeneous in its structural and functional organization and shows high variability across individuals. Despite decades of research, the relationship between specific IFC regions and reading skill remains unclear. To shed light on the function of IFC in reading, we aim to (1) characterize the functional landscape of text-selective responses in the IFC, while accounting for interindividual variability; and (2) examine how text-selective regions in the IFC relate to reading proficiency. To this end, children with a wide range of reading ability (N=66; age 7-14 years, 34 female, 32 male) completed functional MRI scans while performing two tasks on text and non-text visual stimuli. Importantly, both tasks do not explicitly require reading, and can be performed on all visual stimuli. This design allows us to tease apart stimulus-driven responses from task-driven responses and examine where in the IFC task and stimulus interact. We were able to identify three anatomically-distinct, text-selective clusters of activation in the IFC, in the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), and dorsal and ventral precentral gyrus (PrG). These three regions showed a strong task effect that was highly specific to text. Furthermore, text-selectivity in the IFS and dorsal PrG was associated with reading proficiency, such that better readers showed higher selectivity to text. These findings suggest that text-selective regions in the IFC are sensitive to both stimulus and task, and highlight the importance of this region for proficient reading.
**Significance statement** The inferior frontal cortex (IFC) is a critical region for language processing, yet despite decades of research, its relationship with reading skill remains unclear. In a group of children with a wide range of reading skills, we were able to identify three anatomically distinct text-selective clusters of activation in the IFC. These regions showed a strong task effect that was highly selective to text. Text-selectivity was positively correlated with reading proficiency, such that better readers showed higher selectivity to text, even in tasks that did not require reading. These findings suggest that multiple text-selective regions within IFC are sensitive to both stimulus and task, and highlight the critical role of IFC for reading proficiency.
