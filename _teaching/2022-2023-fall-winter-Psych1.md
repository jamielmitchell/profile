Teaching Responsibilities
======
As a Teaching Fellow for the Psych One program, I was responsible for leading 1-2 sections every quarter. I would lecture once a week per section, create my own lesson plans, grade assignments, and lead office office hours. In addition to my weekly responsibilities, I would also complete various forms teaching observations and trainings. Teaching faculty and other teaching fellows would observe my classes while I taught and hold meetings with me to review my teaching skills and offer advice. The students in each section would also complete annonymous reviews to provide feedback on my teaching. In the summer prior to teaching my first quarter of the class, I underwent a full day of training in addition to weekly teaching team meetings where all TFs and the teaching professors would meet to work on additional trianing exercises.
